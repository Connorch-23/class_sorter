Welcome to Connor's Class Sorter. This program can be used to sort campers into classes at YMCA Camp Hanes. A couple things to check before you use this system.

1. Make sure you have digitized the camper preferences and updated the class files to account for capacity and whether or not a shooting sports form is needed.
2. Make sure that you know where these files are at on your computer. With most machines you can simply search the name of the file on the computer in either Finder(for Apple products) or Windows File Explorer (Microsoft products). I recommend organizing these files into a folder in order to better keep track of them later down the line.
